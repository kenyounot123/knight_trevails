# knight_trevails
<p>My task was to build a function <em>knight_moves</em> that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another
by outputting all squares<br>
the knight will stop on along the way.<br>
knight_moves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]<br>
knight_moves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]<br>
knight_moves([3,3],[0,0]) == [[3,3],[1,2],[0,0]]</p>
<p>Used knowledge on BFS (Breadth First Search). <br>
Practiced with:<br>
Tree data structure, parent/child nodes, stacks and queues </p>
